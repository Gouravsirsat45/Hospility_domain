🏨 Hospitality Sales Analytics: Power BI Dashboard
A dynamic and insightful dashboard created to analyze sales and operational KPIs for a leading hotel chain—AtliQ Grands—highlighting revenue patterns, booking trends, and occupancy insights across Indian cities.

🔍 Short Description / Purpose
The Hospitality Sales Dashboard in Power BI offers a visual overview of core hospitality metrics like revenue, occupancy, cancellations, and RevPAR. Built as part of the Codebasics Resume Challenge, this project empowers business leaders to make data-driven decisions by spotting performance gaps and opportunities across properties.

🛠 Tech Stack
This interactive report was built using:

📊 Power BI Desktop – For dashboard development and storytelling
🔄 Power Query Editor – For importing, cleaning, and shaping raw data
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – To compute KPIs such as ADR, Realisation %, and No Show %
🧱 Data Modeling – Star schema design linking hotel performance data with calendar dimension
📁 File Format – Developed in .pbix, with data sourced from structured Excel/CSV files

📂 Data Source
Source: Simulated hotel performance dataset
The dataset captures daily room bookings, cancellations, city-wise performance, revenue metrics, and occupancy stats across multiple hotels and platforms.

🌟 Features / Highlights

• Business Problem
AtliQ Grands is facing declining revenue and market share due to poor visibility into operational KPIs. There’s a growing need for decision-makers to gain timely insights to optimize pricing, reduce cancellations, and target high-performing regions.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To build a Power BI dashboard that:

Tracks revenue and booking trends over time

Measures occupancy, RevPAR, and ADR

Highlights city-wise and platform-wise performance

Identifies cancellation patterns and no-show risks

Offers actionable insights through dynamic visuals

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals

🔹 KPI Cards (Top Panel)

Revenue Realized: Total revenue from completed stays

RevPAR: Revenue per available room

ADR: Average revenue per booked room

Occupancy %: Ratio of booked rooms vs. available

📈 Revenue Trends by Week (Line Chart)

Tracks weekly revenue changes

Highlights spikes during weekends and dips during mid-week

📊 Occupancy % by City and Platform (Bar Chart)

Compares room utilization across cities and booking platforms

Identifies performance bottlenecks by region

📉 Cancellation and No Show Trends (Column Chart)

Shows percentage of cancellations and no-shows

Helps assess booking reliability

🏆 City-wise Revenue vs. Occupancy (Bubble Chart)

Visualizes which cities generate more revenue per occupancy rate

Reveals optimization opportunities (e.g., Delhi’s high occupancy but low revenue)

💼 Realisation %, Booking Breakdown (Donut/Stacked Chart)

Tracks how many bookings turn into actual revenue

Distinguishes checked-out, canceled, and no-show reservations

🎓 What I Learned

Data Understanding: Learned key hospitality terms such as RevPAR, ADR, DSRN, URN, etc.

Data Modeling: Created fact-dimension model with time intelligence support

DAX Functions:

CALCULATE, FILTER – for KPI logic

% Change Week-over-Week – for revenue trend analysis

Booking status segmentation and custom percentages

Visual Design:

Card and trend visuals

Category filters and cross-filtering

Conditional formatting for alerts

📘 Business Terms Explored

RevPAR = Revenue / Available Room Nights

ADR = Revenue / Booked Room Nights

Occupancy % = Booked Rooms / Available Rooms

Realisation % = Revenue-generating bookings / Total bookings

DSRN / DBRN / URN = Metrics for room availability and utilization

No Show % = Guests who booked but didn’t show

Cancellation % = Bookings canceled before check-in

📌 Outcome
This project deepened my understanding of how Power BI enables decision-making in the hotel industry. I explored how analytics can drive occupancy, revenue, and operational efficiency through actionable insights.
